Background Information: The United States Census Bureau, leads the countryâ€™s Federal Statistical System; its primary responsibility is to collect data about the American people and economy to help inform strategic initiatives. Every ten years, the census is conducted to mine information regarding the US population to inform the allocation of billions of dollars of funding to various endeavors (e.g., the building and maintaining of hospitals, schools, fire departments, transportation infrastructure, etc.). Additionally, the collection of census information helps examine the demographic characteristics of subpopulations across the country.

This project uses a sample dataset from the US Census archive containing detailed, anonymized information for ~300,000 individuals.
